## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- Angular CLI

### Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the template
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd auth-ui
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
ng serve
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

## Development

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build & Deployment

### Development Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Production Build

For optimized production builds with performance enhancements:

```bash
npm run build:prod
```

This command uses optimized settings for:

- JavaScript minification
- CSS purging and optimization
- Dead code elimination
- Asset optimization

### Serving Production Build

To serve the production build with compression and performance optimizations:

```bash
npm run serve:prod
```

This uses an Express server with the following optimizations:

- GZIP compression for all assets
- Optimized static file serving
- Client-side routing support

## Performance Optimizations

The template includes several performance optimizations:

- **CSS Purging**: Removes unused Tailwind CSS classes in production
- **Asset Compression**: GZIP compression for faster downloads
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy-loaded modules for faster initial loading
- **Font Loading Optimization**: Non-blocking font loading strategy
- **Minification**: Optimized JavaScript and CSS

## Customization

The template is built with customization in mind:

- **Colors**: Update the color scheme in `tailwind.config.js` and `styles.scss`
- **Animations**: Modify animations in `styles.scss`
- **Form Fields**: Easily add or remove fields in the authentication components
- **Logo**: Replace the logo in the authentication pages

## Integration with Authentication Providers

This template can be easily integrated with various authentication providers:

1. **Firebase Authentication**
2. **Auth0**
3. **AWS Cognito**
4. **Keycloak**
5. **Custom authentication backend**
